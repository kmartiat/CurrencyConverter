# üí± Currency Converter ![Status badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

> This is one of the challenges proposed by Alura Latam in the Oracle Next Education program.

This project is a currency converter program. It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using the
current exchange rates it obtains from requests to the https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ API.

## üöÄ Demo

The program displays a main menu where the user can select between the options of performing a conversion, viewing the
conversion history, or exiting the execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

1. `Main`: This class contains the interactive menu and serves as a connection to the other classes.

   exchange rates.
3. `Currency`: This class represents a currency conversion, with properties such as source currency, destination
   currency, exchange rate, converted amount, and timestamp.
4. `CurrencyDTO`: This class allows to transfer the data from the API response to the Currency class.
5. `CurrencyConverter`: This class contains the logic to perform currency conversions.
6. `Literals`: This class is a utility class that contains the menu and textual interface options.
